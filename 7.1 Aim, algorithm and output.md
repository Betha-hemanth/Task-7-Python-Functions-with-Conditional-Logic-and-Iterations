Aim: To develop Python functions that solve real-life problems using conditional logic, iteration, and validations to produce correct and meaningful results.

7.1 Library Fine Calculation

Algorithm:

1. Input the number of late days (days).

2. If days <= 5, fine = days * 2.

3. Else if days <= 10, fine = (5 * 2) + (days - 5) * 3.

4. Else, fine = (5 * 2) + (5 * 3) + (days - 10) * 5.

5. Output the fine.

output:

35
